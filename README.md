# Tyson MRS Tool
This tool was created for Tyson Foods Master Data Management Team to deal with the old requests and clogged inboxes in the Master Request System

# Ownership
Provide the tool with a list of MRS Request IDs and the program will automatically force ownership of these items. This allows the user to make changes to these requests

# Withdraw
The tool will go through the users inbox and withdraw requests from the inbox giving a reason why in the comment section. This works top to bottom in the inbox but you can give the program a starting position.

# Reject
This tool will go through the users inbox in the same way as the withdraw tool but instead will reject requests rather than withdrawing them. It will still leave a comment for the reason as well.
